# watchd 

## Description

This extension was created in order to fix a common issue people binge-watching on YouTube might have faced.<br>
<br>
The purpose is to inject a button in current YouTube UI to keep track of the watchtime on a per video basis.<br>
Watchtime is displayed in percentage, and is updated everytime the video is played from paused state, or paused.<br>
<br>
A tick symbol is also added to the button when the end of the video was reached, independant of the video watchtime.<br>
<br>
The data is stored in browser localstorage, and can't unfortunately be shared across devices yet.<br>
